                <h2>The goal of this website</h2>

                <p class="notop">Is inspired by a Hadith from Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)
                    <br><br>

                    <blockquote>Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<br>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, "When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: <br>Ongoing Charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), Beneficial Knowledge and a virtuous descendant who prays for him (for the deceased).<br><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1631?ref=blog.abdalnasr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sahih Muslim 1631</a></blockquote>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ongoing Charity</strong>: I'm not yet sure how this website will achieve this goal, but InshAllah God will reveal this to me at the appointed time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Beneficial Knowledge</strong>: Sharing useful information that people may find helpful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>A virtuous descendant who prays for him:</strong> If God blesses me with offspring. I would love for this to be a reference they can use to remember me and keep me in their duas (prayers).
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            <div>
                <h2>Formerly Known as <a href="https://tomiwa.ca/" target="_blank">Tomiwa Ademidun</a></h2>
                That was my name before <a href="https://blog.tomiwa.ca/my-religious-beliefs/" target="_blank">I became Muslim</a>.
                Some people still call me that. <br><br>
                Becoming Muslim has been such a profound change on my life that I am gradually transitioning to a new identity to reflect externally the change I feel spiritually.
                <br><br>
                Rather than delete or downplay my past identity prior to Islam, I look at it as a digital archive of the man I used to be and the person I have turned into through the mercy of God.
