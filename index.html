            <p>
                My name is Abd Al-Nasr. I am a Muslim. I enjoy worshipping God, reading Qur'an, doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawah" target="_blank">Dawah</a> <a href="https://blog.abdalnasr.com/invitation-to-god/">(inviting others to Islam)</a>, spending time with family and friends, reading, writing, farming, cooking and cleaning.
            </p>

            <h3>Previously Known as Tomiwa Ademidun</h3>
            Before I became<a href="https://blog.tomiwa.ca/my-religious-beliefs/">I became Muslim</a>, I went by Tomiwa Ademidun.
            Becoming Muslim had such a profound change on my life that I am gradually in the process of transitioning to a new identity to reflect externally the change I feel spiritually.

            However, rather than delete my identity in my period of Jahiliya (ignorance) prior to Islam can be a useful guide for people to see my journey and for me to reflect and help myself and those around me
            acclamatize to this new change.
